	FileSystem         -> map of paths.    Keep
	EventActionMapping -> map of events.   Keep
	Engine             -> map of aspects   Replace
	Core               -> map of engines   Replace
	
##### Engine
* Bidirectional
* Sequential
* Prioritize fast access
* `vector<shared_ptr<...>>`

##### Core
* Use a `vector<engine *>`
* `dynamic_cast<T>` each engine
* Return any engine that does not give nullptr
* Otherwise create new engine

Also consider sets:
