Stop IE work once Colin is done, then start plugin work. our goal is every 3 to 4 month starting with DLSS. 

Conor, Colin, Zach
Luca, Ethan, Joel?
Talk to Luca about staying on and what that will entail

1. general notification to tell people to start working 
2. Start development environment with Colin and Conor so that we all understand how to start

Nvidia has a DLSS plugin for the HDRP, refer to their documentation

DLSS Plugin:
1. Initialize NGX
2. generate our own motion vectors on the URP (at least 16 bits per pixel)
3. Pass motion vectors into DLSS
4. Use new framebuffer for postprocessing
