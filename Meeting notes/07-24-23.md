- [x] #todo NativePluginLoader so that we don't have to restart Unity every time we edit the c++ file
	- Add file NativePluginLoader.cs
	- Use format 1  for method declarations 
	- Use format 2 for class/plugin file declarations
```1
PluginFunctionAttr("mehDebug")] // Must match the name of the function in the C++ file.  
public static _mehDebug mehDebug = null; // The first identifier does not matter. The second is the name that will be used in the C# script.  
public delegate void _mehDebug();
```
```2
[PluginAttr("libDLSSPlugin")] // Must include "lib" before the plugin name. Plugin must be stored in "Assets/Plugins".  
public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour {...}
```
