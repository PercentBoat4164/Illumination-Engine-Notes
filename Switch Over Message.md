@Everyone Please read and consider this.

# Attention
As of the current time, Illumination Engine's production has been postponed. This is due to the fact that we have chosen to pivot as a company. We have decided to focus on making our business profitable before achieving the goals that we have set. This has required us to restructure our business strategy. Illumination Engine is no longer our primary focus as the time to hit a minimum viable product is so high that it is not feasible to go that long without any profit. To help offset this, as well as gain some insight into the industry, we have chosen to switch our focus to middleware.
# Developing Middleware
The choice to do this was not made lightly. My ultimate goal for this company revolves around Illumination Engine and the value it will bring to the industry. However, we cannot bring Illumination Engine to market without funding. After speaking with multiple business and industry professionals, we made the choice to produce middleware. We chose to develop middleware because it has a very low time to market, introduces us into the industry, has largely untapped potential, and is financially viable. The middleware that we will be developing will be plugins for the Unity and Unreal game engines.
# What Should I do now
All current work on Illumination Engine should be paused. Expect to return to it at some point in the future, but for now the need to focus on making the business profitable is paramount. Work that is in progress should be pushed to the GitHub. Any tasks currently being worked on should be paused. Expect new tasks revolving around middleware workflows to come within the next month.
# This is a Good Thing
This is a good thing. It means that we can actually achieve our dreams of changing the way that games are made. It provides us with the financial tools and connections that we need to establish ourselves in the industry. After we get a foothold in the market, we can once again focus on Illumination Engine. Developing middleware will help us to enter into a market that has competitors on our level, and makes becoming a profitable company manageable.
# Being Transparent
Profit is not our primary goal, but rather a means to an end. The goals and values of Conifer Computing Company have not changed. This message is us recognizing that our previous course of business is not feasible in the long term and would have ultimately resulted in our failure. In order to exist as a company we need to make money, hence our recent decisions.
# Company Wide Meeting
A company wide meeting will be held on Tuesday, July 25th at 2:00 PM. This will be a time for anyone to ask questions, make comments, or give advice. If you cannot attend the meeting, all of the audio will be recorded and posted onto the Discord for future reference. If the file is too large for Discord it will be made available in some other way.

Thank you,
